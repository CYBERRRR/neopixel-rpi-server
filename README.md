neopixel-strip-server
=====================

Simple Flask application for the **Raspberry Pi** that shows a **color picker** and changes the led color on your **NeoPixel strip**.

It's using the color picker from https://github.com/josedvq/colpick-jQuery-Color-Picker and the NeoPixel Python lib from https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x. Just follow the installation instructons on both.
